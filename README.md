In discrete mathematics, especially theoretical computer science,
it is common to have a family of problems characterized by a finite set of
discrete parameters, and have a result (or open problem) for each problem
in the family.  How can we best organize this high-dimensional matrix of
information into a human-readable 2D table?

[***Hyper-Table***](https://65440-2023.github.io/hyper-table/)
is a tool for exploring the space of possible table layouts,
assuming the table must explicitly represent the entire space of problems.
You can drag around which parameters should be on the horizontal vs. vertical
axis, and in what priority order they should be expanded.

The tool comes with several example results tables from real papers
for you to experiment with.  Select one from the drop down.
You can also upload a custom data file,
though the file format is not yet documented.

This tool was built to illustrate the forthcoming paper
“Hardness Table Layout Hardness Table”
by MIT Hardness Group, Josh Brunner, Andy Tockman, Frederick Stock, Della Hendrickson, Hayashi Layers, Timothy Gomez, Erik D. Demaine, Jenny Diomidova (2025).
In particular, it includes several example tables from that paper.
